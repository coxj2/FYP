				<h1 class="page-title">Privacy Policy</h1>		 		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the privacy notice of Fulfil Nutrition Ltd. In this document, “we”, “our”, or “us” refer to Fulfil Nutrition Ltd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are company number 570668, registered in Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our registered office is at Fulfil Nutrition, Unit B1, Hume Centre, Parkwest Industrial Park, Nangor Road, Dublin 12, Ireland.</span></p>
<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a notice to inform you of our policy about all information that we receive from you. It sets out the conditions under which we may process any information that we collect from you, or that you provide to us. It covers information that could identify you (“personal information”) and information that could not. In the context of the law and this notice, “process” means collect, store, transfer, use or otherwise act on information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We take seriously the protection of your privacy and confidentiality. We understand that all visitors to our website are entitled to know that their personal data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them and will not accidentally fall into the hands of a third party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information you provide to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our policy complies with law accordingly implemented, including that required by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law requires us to tell you about your rights and our obligations to you with regards to the processing and control of your personal data. We do this now, by requesting that you read the information provided at </span><a href="http://www.gdprandyou.ie"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://gdprandyou.ie/</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except as set out below, we do not share, sell, or disclose to a third party, any information collected through our website.</span></p>
<h2><b>The bases on which we process information about you</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law requires us to determine under which defined bases we process different categories of your personal information, and to notify you of the basis for each category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a basis on which we process your personal information is no longer relevant then we shall immediately stop processing your data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the basis changes then if required by law we shall notify you of the change and of any new basis under which we have determined that we can continue to process your information.</span></p>
<h3><b>1 Information we process because we have an obligation to you</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you contact us through our website, requesting to receive our newsletter, enter a competition, or for another purpose, or otherwise agree to our terms and conditions, an agreement is formed between you and us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to carry out our obligations under that agreement we must process the information you give us. Some of this information may be personal information.</span></p>
<p><b>We may use it in order to:</b></p>
<p><b>1.1.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> verify your identity for security purposes.</span></p>
<p><b>1.2.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> advise and sell services to you.</span></p>
<p><b>1.3.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provide you with our services.</span></p>
<p><b>1.4.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provide you with suggestions and advice on products, services and how to obtain the most from using our website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We process this information on the basis there is an agreement between us, or that you have requested we use the information in order to resolve your enquiry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, we may aggregate this information in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example to monitor our performance with respect to a particular service we provide. If we use it for this purpose, you as an individual will not be personally identifiable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We shall continue to process this information until the agreement between us ends or is terminated by either party when your enquiry is resolved.</span></p>
<h3><b>2 Information we process with your consent</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through certain actions when otherwise there is no obligation for us to use your information, such as when you browse our website or ask us to provide you more information about our products or business, you provide your consent to us to process information that may be personal information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process this information, for example, by asking you to agree to our use of cookies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes you might give your consent implicitly, such as when you send us a message by e-mail to which you would reasonably expect us to reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except where you have consented to our use of your information for a specific purpose, we do not use your information in any way that would identify you personally. We may aggregate it in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example to monitor the performance of a particular page on our website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have given us explicit permission to do so, we may from time to time pass your name and contact information to selected associates whom we consider may provide services or products you would find useful. This would be done on an individual basis, and with your permission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We continue to process your information on this basis until you withdraw your consent or it can be reasonably assumed that your consent no longer exists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us at </span><a href="&#x6d;ai&#x6c;to&#x3a;he&#x6c;lo&#x40;fu&#x6c;fi&#x6c;&#110;u&#x74;&#114;i&#x74;&#105;o&#x6e;&#46;c&#x6f;&#109;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#104;e&#x6c;l&#x6f;&#64;&#x66;u&#x6c;f&#x69;l&#x6e;u&#x74;r&#x69;t&#x69;&#111;&#x6e;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or via our website.</span></p>
<h3><b>3 Information we process for the purposes of legitimate interests</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may process information on the basis there is a legitimate interest, either to you or to us, of doing so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where we process your information on this basis, we do so after having given careful consideration to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whether the same objective could be achieved through other means.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether you would consider it reasonable to do so.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, we may process your data on this basis for the purposes of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of our business.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> responding to unsolicited communication from you to which we believe you would expect a response.</span></li>

We do this as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our sole discretion as to whether we do give information, and if we do, what that information is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from this source to assess the level of service we provide, but not in a way that could identify you or any other person.</span></p>
