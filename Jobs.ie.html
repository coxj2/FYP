<p><b>Customer control of your personal data</b></p>

<p><b>International data transfers</b></p>

<p>Your personal data may be transferred, stored and accessed within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or transferred to, stored in, and accessed from countries outside the EEA in order to fulfil the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.  For transfers to countries outside the EEA, the data protection regime may be different than in the country in which you are located and will therefore be based on a legally adequate transfer method.   Whenever Jobs.ie transfers your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is given to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Where the country has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.  For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.</li>
    <li>We may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.  For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</li>
    <li>Where service providers are based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.  For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield. </li>
</ul>

<p>We will provide you on request a list of the countries located outside the EEA to which personal data may be transferred, and an indication of whether they have been determined by the European Commission to grant adequate protection to personal data. Where applicable, you are entitled, upon request to receive a copy of the relevant safeguard (for example, EC model contractual clauses) that has been taken to protect personal data during such transfer.  </p>

<p><b>Data retention</b></p>

<p>We retain personal data for no longer than is allowed under data protection law and, in any case, no longer than such personal data is necessary for the purpose for which it was processed.  To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

<p>As a registered user of the Website we will retain your Identity, Contact, Profile, Technical, Usage, Marketing and Communications Data for as long as your user account is live. We retain the personal data you provide while your account is in existence or as needed to provide you access to the Website and any Jobs.ie Service you have used.  Even if you only use the Website or any other Jobs.ie Service occasionally, we will retain your Identity, Contact, Profile, Technical, Usage, Marketing and Communications Data until you decide to close your user account. In some cases we retain certain Usage Data (e.g. visitor and application statistics in a depersonalized or aggregated form).  Also, we retain personal data for longer if required by applicable law or regulation or justified under applicable statutory limitation periods.</p>

<p>If you respond to a Job Specification, publish your CV/resume on our CV Database or otherwise communicate with Customers via the Website a copy of your job application, CV/resume and a record of the communication will be held the Customer’s user account. The copy of your job application CV/resume and record of communication will remain on the Customer's user account for no more than 18 months after the job specification has been archived.  We will delete that copy of your application CV/resume and record of communication from the Customer’s user account 18 months from the date the job specification is archived, unless you have exercised Your Legal Rights of erasure of that personal data before this.  Details of all the job applications you make through the Website can be viewed by you in Your Account.</p>

<p><b>Your legal rights</b></p>

<p>Under certain circumstances you have rights under applicable data protection law in relation to personal data, namely: </p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Request access to your personal data</b> (commonly known as a "data subject access request").  This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
    <li><b>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.</b>  This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
    <li><b>Request erasure of your personal data.</b>  This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.  You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.  Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. </li>
    <li><b>Object to processing of your personal data</b> where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.  You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.  In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
    <li><b>Request restriction of processing of your personal data.</b>  This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. </li>
    <li><b>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.</b>  We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.  Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. </li>
    <li><b>Withdraw consent</b> at any time if and to the extent we are relying on consent as the legal basis to process your personal data.  However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.  If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.  We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding your right to have your personal data erased, you can delete your user account with Jobs.ie at any time. Deleting your user account deletes records of job applications sent, CVs and cover letters stored in your account, your profile, saved jobs and job alerts. Once your user account is deleted, it is gone forever and cannot be restored. Some personal data however may still be stored and visible in other places on the Website. For example, if you have applied for a job, your application information including your name, email, CV and cover letter may still be visible to the Customer in their user account on the Website. We will endeavor to contact Customers we know who have accessed your personal data within the previous 18 months and inform them of your request to erase your personal data.  </p>

<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).  However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.  Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.  We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).  This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.  We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.  </p>

<p>In order to exercise one or more of your rights in respect of your personal data, you can do so from the Account Settings option in Your Account on the Website. Alternatively, please contact us at <a href="mailto:gdpr@Jobs.ie">gdpr@Jobs.ie</a> . We will respond to your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any case within the legally required period of time.</p>

<p>You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Data Protection Commission, the Irish supervisory authority for data protection issues (<a href="http://www.dataprotection.ie/">www.dataprotection.ie</a>).  We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the Data Protection Commission so please contact us in the first instance at <a href="mailto:gdpr@Jobs.ie">gdpr@Jobs.ie</a></p>
